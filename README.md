A social betting platform that brings friends together through friendly wagers and competitive fun. Built during the COVID pandemic as a way for friends to interact and collect points (or money) as entertainment, this platform has evolved into a comprehensive betting ecosystem.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The initial design was conceived during the COVID pandemic as a creative solution for friends to stay connected and engaged through friendly competition. What started as a simple amusement has grown into a sophisticated betting platform that combines real-world events with social interaction.

### Key Features
- **Real Event Betting**: Create bets based on real events registered in the platform (soccer games, eSports matches, etc.)
- **Custom Betting Channels**: Administrators can create public or private channels with custom "betting criteria"
- **Social Interaction**: Connect with friends through shared betting experiences
- **Flexible Scoring**: Support for both points-based and monetary betting systems

## 🎨 Design & Prototyping

The platform's design and user experience were carefully crafted in Figma:
