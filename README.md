A social betting platform that brings friends together through friendly wagers and competitive fun. Built during the COVID pandemic as a way for friends to interact and collect points (or money) as entertainment, this platform has evolved into a comprehensive betting ecosystem.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The initial design was conceived during the COVID pandemic as a creative solution for friends to stay connected and engaged through friendly competition. What started as a simple amusement has grown into a sophisticated betting platform that combines real-world events with social interaction.

### Key Features
- **Real Event Betting**: Create bets based on real events registered in the platform (soccer games, eSports matches, etc.)
- **Custom Betting Channels**: Administrators can create public or private channels with custom "betting criteria"
- **Social Interaction**: Connect with friends through shared betting experiences
- **Flexible Scoring**: Support for both points-based and monetary betting systems

## 🎨 Design & Prototyping

The platform's design and user experience were carefully crafted in Figma:

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for mobile app)
- Java 17+ (for backend)
- Maven 3.6+ (or use Maven Wrapper included in project)
- Expo CLI

### Development

#### Mobile App
```bash
make dev-mobile
# or
cd mobile && npm start
```

#### Backend
```bash
make dev-backend
# or
cd backend && ./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## 🛠️ Available Commands

Run `make help` to list all targets and their descriptions.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make dev-mobile` | Start the Expo development server |
| `make dev-backend` | Start the Spring Boot development server |
| `make dev` | Alias for `dev-mobile` (default development command) |
| `make dev-seed` | Run the database seeder (requires backend running on port 8080) |
| `make db-reset` | Reset the database: kill 8080, start backend with profile `reset` (schema drop + recreate), run seed, then stop backend. Use after schema changes. Next backend run should be without the `reset` profile. |
| `make install-mobile` | Install mobile app dependencies |
| `make install-backend` | Install backend dependencies |
| `make setup` | Install all dependencies (mobile + backend) |
| `make clean` | Remove build artifacts and dependencies (node_modules, backend/target) |
| `make help` | Show all available make targets |

## 🤝 Contributing

Each project maintains its own dependencies and configuration. Changes to the mobile app should be made in the `mobile/` directory, and backend changes in the `backend/` directory.

## 📱 Mobile App Features
